1. Prepare QEMU & toolchain:
https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/tools.html

2. Run QEMU in console-only envrionment:
  (1) get sgabios from https://github.com/qemu/sgabios
      compile got sgabios.bin
      put sgabios.bin into $PATH
  (2) qemu-system-i386 -nographic -device sga [image]
  
3. The problem of this method is that could not quit from console, 
    solution is use telnet to monitor the qemu 
    
    qemu-system-i386 -nographic -device sga -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:1234,server,nowait [image]
    
    open another console window, telnet 127.0.0.1 1234, and then you could got QEMU command line, then quit could exit the previous qemu
